What the Heck is GitHub?
William Cwik

A programmer wants to work on an app project or some java for a website. They start the coding and have files and folders 
on their computer. The programmer uploads this to GitHub into a repository. The Repository os simply a copy of the files 
as they are at that point. The programmer keeps working on their app and then sends the new copy to GitHub. GitHub saves
 that copy in the repository and says that it is the main copy, while maintaining the previous copy as a version. This I
 like an undo that lives forever or in Indesign when you copy a page and continue working on that one while the old one
 still exists. It allows the programmer to go back if they need to. The programmer needs help with the code so they ask a
 colleague to work on it. The colleague copies the most current version from GitHub on their computer and starts working
 on it. As this programmer saves changes, new copies are posted to GitHub allowing the other programmer to copy the new
 version to work on. Both the programmers now reach a point where they are having trouble. They open up the repository to
 the community, asking for help. Other programmers are able to download the current copy of the code, make changes and
 upload them back to GitHub in the same way. The new upload is then made the current version and the previous one is added
 to the lit of saved versions....

GitHub was created for specifically for programmers based off the Git software created in 2005 for Linux development so
 there is a workflow that is specific to them. It can host many other files for uses other than programming like text and
 image files, these are much fewer. The standard free account allows unlimited repositories open to the public and no
 private ones. Personal private repositories can be purchased for a monthly fee of about $1 per private repository.
 Organizational accounts are more expensive.
